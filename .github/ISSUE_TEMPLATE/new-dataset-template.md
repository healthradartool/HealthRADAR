## Tags describing the dataset  (max 6)

Choose tags from the list below or add new tags

- Global, regional, country-level, urban, rural
- Annual, monthly, daily, hourly
- Epidemiology, climate, intervention,  demography, entomology

## About the data

Describe the dataset generally. Make sure to include how the data are/were collected, the spatial and temporal resolution as well as its intended purpose.

## Accessing the data

Describe where and how the data can be accessed. 

## What does the data look like?

### Description

Keep it short and to the point. What is the type of data (annual, monthly etc.)? How often is it updated? If there are multiple datasets then provide a short description for each one. Also mention where historical data can be found if necessary and some caveats (if known) with the datasets. Think about the lifespan of any links that you include.

## How to use this data?

If you are comfortable coding up the access to the data, then place the code chunk in the template here. Provide a brief summary of the dataset once it is read in (first ~50 lines). If you are not comfortable with code, then leave this section blank. 

```
insert code chunk
```

## How to plot this data?

Once again, if you are comfortable coding up a few interesting plots to visualise the data, then please include that here. Take a look at the plotting templates in the resources to get an idea of plotting styles. If you cannot do the coding section, then please ignore that section and provide an explanation of a plot that would benefit the end used. An example description could be:

"Line plots of the annual reported malaria cases for country A, B, C and D for the period 2000 - 2022" 

```
insert code chunk
```

## Key points to consider

These are short, dataset specific bullet points that bring attention to certain features of the data that an end user might overlook. These could be the fact that the dataset contains annual data which means that trends within years would not be captured (all data points generated at the end of year, for example)


## Examples of data use in literature
