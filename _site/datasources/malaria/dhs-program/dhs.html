About the data
</h2>
<p>The DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys) Program provides data on population, health, and nutrition through more than 400 surveys in over 90 countries. Data covers the following areas; <em>Population and Demographics, Fertility and Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition, HIV/AIDS and Other Infections, Malaria, &amp; Gender and Domestic Violence</em>.</p>
<p>The DHS data are widely used by governments, NGOs, researchers, and policymakers to design and monitor health programs and policies. The surveys are conducted through face-to-face interviews with representative samples of households, and they use standardized questionnaires to ensure comparability across countries and over time.</p>
<p>Demographic health surveys are also unique for modelling as you can correlate across various datasets variables for example linking Malaria data on prevention and treatment to other factors in the population and demographics data to other health system indicators</p>
<h2 class="anchored">
Accessing the data

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accessing-the-data-using-statcompiler">Accessing the data using STATcompiler</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prevalence and Treatment</strong>: Users can access data on malaria prevalence and treatment practices directly from the <a href="https://www.STATcompiler%20.com/en/">STATcompiler</a>. It allows for the creation of tables, charts, and maps that display malaria prevalence rates, treatment practices, and trends over time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preventive Measures</strong>: STATcompiler provides data on the ownership and use of ITNs, IRS coverage, and IPTp usage. Users can visualize how these preventive measures vary across different regions and demographic groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Country and Regional Comparisons</strong>: STATcompiler enables users to compare malaria data across different countries and regions. This comparative analysis helps in identifying best practices and areas that require more attention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Temporal Trends</strong>: Users can analyze trends over time to see how malaria prevention and treatment efforts have evolved and their impact on malaria prevalence and morbidity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tailored Data Retrieval</strong>: STATcompiler allows users to create custom tables based on specific indicators related to malaria. Users can filter data by variables such as age, sex, urban/rural residence, and wealth quintile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indicator Selection</strong>: Users can select specific indicators related to malaria, such as ITN usage, malaria prevalence among children under five, and access to malaria treatment. This customization helps in focusing on particular aspects of malaria control and prevention.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Holistic Health Analysis</strong>: STATcompiler can integrate malaria data with other health indicators, such as child mortality rates, nutrition status, and maternal health. This integration provides a comprehensive view of health challenges and the interconnections between different health issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Indicator Analysis</strong>: Users can analyse how malaria prevention and treatment efforts correlate with other health outcomes, facilitating a broader understanding of health dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive Tools</strong>: STATcompiler offers an interactive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and extract relevant malaria data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Export</strong>: Users can export data in various formats (e.g., Excel, CSV) for further analysis or reporting purposes.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Policy Making and Program Design</strong>: Policymakers and program designers can access up-to-date malaria data, helping them create evidence-based strategies and allocate resources effectively.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research and Academic Studies</strong>: Researchers can utilize STATcompiler to obtain detailed malaria data for their studies, facilitating in-depth analysis and publication of findings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring and Evaluation</strong>: Health organizations can monitor the progress of malaria interventions by analysing trends and identifying gaps in coverage .</p></li>

How can this data be used in disease modelling?
</h2>
<p>The DHS dataset has various components that can be incorporated into malaria modelling, particularly with respect to health systems and interventions. Upon exploring the data, many indicators from the DHS surveys may be associated with the system dynamics of malaria. We include a few examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of children age 6-59 months tested for malaria using microscopy</p></li>
<li><p>Percentage of pregnant women who slept under a long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) the night before the survey</p></li>
<li><p>Among children with fever in the two weeks preceding the survey for whom advice or treatment was sought, the percentage for whom the source was a government health center, traditional practitioner, shop or private doctor</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In modelling LLIN effective coverage, we account for the number of households that actually receive nets, appropriate usage, insecticide efficacy and the physical integrity of the net. Human and vector behavioural characteristics pertaining to where people spending their evenings (during peak biting times), or the likelihood of indoor vector biting are captured as <em>operational effectiveness</em> <span class="math inline">\(opp_{eff}\)</span>. Another illustration of this is depicted below:</p>

<p>In the simple example below, we obtain data on LLIN access and usage rates in Kenya from the DHS, and compare this to data on ITN distribution from the World Malaria Report. Finally, we model the effective coverage of LLINs. This represents the proportion of the population actually protected from malaria transmission by LLINs in a particular country.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-assumptions">Model assumptions</h3>
<p>We make a few assumptions about LLINs in the model, explicitly stated here. We assume:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Net usage remains consistent until a new survey is conducted.</p></li>
<li><p>Net functionality and effectiveness declines at a rate of approximately 25% per year, with LLINs considered ‘expired’ or no longer effective after three years of use.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like to expand this into a p</p>
<ul>
<li>Operational effectiveness (<span class="math inline">\(opp_{eff}\)</span>): 65% of actual bites from an indoor-biting infectious mosquito are assumed to be prevented by LLINs used correctly during peak biting times.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="coverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="coverage">Coverage</h3>
<p>Coverage is dependent on access to LLINs at the distribution rate of two persons per net. The reported number of ITNs distributed in a given year in each country can be obtained from the World Malaria Report Annex <em>4-D</em>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-access"><span class="math display">\[
\textrm {Access} = \frac {\textrm{Nets distributed} \times 2}{\textrm {Population at risk}} - \textrm {losses due to insecticide decay and physical wear and tear}
\tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Subsequently, <em>effective</em> coverage can be quite low due to imperfect usage and operational effectiveness.</p>
<p><span id="eq-cov"><span class="math display">\[
\textrm{Effective Coverage} = \textrm{access} \times \textrm {usage rate} \times \textrm{operational effectiveness}
\tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The timelines of the datasets do not align: DHS survey data on LLIN access are available for the years 2008, 2014, and 2015, while net usage data are available for 2008, 2014, 2015, 2020, and 2022. The World Malaria Report provides LLIN access values only for the three years preceding the 2023 report. Nonetheless, we present both LLIN access values and the calculated effective coverage in the same figure below for illustrative purposes.</p>

<p>Gaps between access to LLINs and actual effective coverage can justify increasing the frequency of mass distribution campaigns or implementing continuous distribution channels through schools and health clinics. Where these gaps stem from low usage rates, targeted social and behavioural change campaigns may be necessary to improve net use. Alternatively, if low effective coverage is due to vector insecticide resistance, switching to nets with different or enhanced active ingredients may prove to be a better strategy. In settings where human behaviour (spending evenings outdoors in fields, at taverns, or fishing) limits the operational effectiveness of LLINs, complementary strategies to address outdoor biting could be considered.</p>
