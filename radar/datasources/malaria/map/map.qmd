<h2>About the data</h2>

The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) is a leading global resource that compiles and analyses spatial data on malaria transmission and prevalence. By providing high-resolution maps and geospatial models, MAP supports researchers, policy-makers, and health organisations in understanding the distribution and burden of malaria, enabling targeted interventions and informed decision-making to combat the disease effectively.
