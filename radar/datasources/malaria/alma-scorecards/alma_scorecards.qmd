## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

- The site uses two languages, namely, *English* and *French*.
-   The data is presented in the form of scorecards showing several indicators that are used to assess a country's health priorities.
- Indicators may vary from country to country, countries generally choose indicators based on their national health strategies.
- There are currently: 40 malaria country level tools, 1 country level scorecard tool that combines malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
- There are 3 types of scorecards available: country scorecards, community scorecards  and the ALMA scorecard for accountability and action.
- The country scorecard provides a snapshot of a country's health performance.
- The community scorecard provides a means for assessing the quality of health services offered at the local health facility or catchment area.
- The ALMA scorecard for accountability and action displays country level performance against key indicators, highlighting successes and shortfalls.

<h2>Accessing the data</h2>

- To view the available scorecards visit [Scorecard management tools](https://scorecardhub.org/scorecards/). 
- No login credentials are needed to view or download the available scorecards
- Login credentials are needed if an individual wishes to undertake any of the [online courses](https://scorecardhub.org/online-courses) offered by ALMA.
- Under the tab country scorecards, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *country*, *scorecard type* and *year*. To access the scorecards on *malaria*, use the filter *scorecard type* and choose any of the following depending on specific context (*Malaria*, *ALMA Scorecard for Accountability on Action*, *Commonwealth Malaria Tracker*) from the drop-down menu.
- Under the tab country best practices, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *search*, *topic*, *types of best practices*, *country* and *year*. To access best practices for malaria, use the filter *topic*, 2 choices are available: *Malaria scorecard tools* and *End malaria councils* from the drop-down menu.
- The video below demonstrates how to navigate the site:

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

- Some scorecards are shared as pdf files (these are downloadable)

![Rwanda Malaria Scorecard](images/pdf_scorecard.png)

or directly from the web platform (not downloadable, user has to scroll through the file)

![Zambia Malaria Scorecard](images/web_platform%20scorecard.png)

- Scorecards are color coded, the main colors of use are *green (on track)*, *yellow (in progress)*, *red (not on track)*, *grey (not applicable or no data)*, *white (no data)*.
- Scorecards use arrows in combination with the colors, *up arrow (to show an increase)* and *down arrow (to show a decrease)*.
- The ALMA scorecards for accountability and action gives the ALMA scorecard, the Africa Summary report and country specific reports as pdfs in any one of the following languages, *English*, *Arabic*, *Spanish*, *French*, *Swahili* and *Portuguese*.
- Data available is for the years 2015 to 2024.

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

- Downloading the [materials](https://scorecardhub.org/guides-and-toolkits/download-course-content-to-access-when-you-do-not-have-an-internet-connection/) for the online courses is highly beneficial, as they provide a comprehensive overview on how to create scorecards. This will help towards the understanding and interpretation of the scorecards.
- The scorecards are highly country specific, indicators change according to the country's health priorities.

## Visualisations

<h2>How to use this data</h2>

- As indicators vary across countries, it is necessary to check if the indicators of interest are within the available scorecards.
- It is also necessary to check if the country of interest has made the country scorecard available.
- As the scorecards are available in pdf format or as a web platform, information has to be extracted manually.

<h2>Tracking indicator perfomance</h2>

- The plot given below highlights how tracking indicator performance can be achieved.
- Several country performances are highlighted using data obtained from ALMA scorecards for accountability and action.
- The implementation indicator on operational vector control (LLINs/IRS) coverage was considered.

When visualising similar data over a much longer period of time, a line plot is useful. Here, the coverage by an LLIN and/or IRS in each of the Frontline 4 countries from 2015 to 2024 is visualised.
```{r}
# Read in data
E8_data <- read_excel("data/E8_implementation.xlsx")
E8_data$LLINs <- as.numeric(E8_data$LLINs)  

# Filter the data for specific countries
E8_data |> 
   # Keep rows where Country is one of the Frontline 4
  filter(Country %in% c("Botswana", "Namibia", "South Africa", "Eswatini")) |> 
  # Create a ggplot object with the filtered data
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = as.numeric(LLINs), group = Country)) +
  # Customize the x-axis to show yearly breaks
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(floor(min(E8_data$Year)), ceiling(max(E8_data$Year)), by = 1)) +  
  # Customize the y-axis to show breaks from 0 to 100 in increments of 10
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10)) +  
  # Add lines to the plot, coloured by Country
  geom_line(aes(color = Country), lwd = 1) +  
  # Add points to the plot, coloured by Country
  geom_point(aes(color = Country), size = 2) +
  # Apply custom colour scale
  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +  
  # Apply custom theme
  theme_health_radar() +
  # Add labels and title to the plot
  labs(
    title = "Operational LLIN or IRS coverage for the Frontline 4 (2015-2024)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Coverage (%)",
    color = "Country",
