## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

- The site uses two languages, namely, *English* and *French*.
-   The data is presented in the form of scorecards showing several indicators that are used to assess a country's health priorities.
- Indicators may vary from country to country, countries generally choose indicators based on their national health strategies.
- There are currently: 40 malaria country level tools, 1 country level scorecard tool that combines malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
- There are 3 types of scorecards available: country scorecards, community scorecards  and the ALMA scorecard for accountability and action.
- The country scorecard provides a snapshot of a country's health performance.
- The community scorecard provides a means for assessing the quality of health services offered at the local health facility or catchment area.
- The ALMA scorecard for accountability and action displays country level performance against key indicators, highlighting successes and shortfalls.

<h2>Accessing the data</h2>

- To view the available scorecards visit [Scorecard management tools](https://scorecardhub.org/scorecards/). 
- No login credentials are needed to view or download the available scorecards
- Login credentials are needed if an individual wishes to undertake any of the [online courses](https://scorecardhub.org/online-courses) offered by ALMA.
- Under the tab country scorecards, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *country*, *scorecard type* and *year*. To access the scorecards on *malaria*, use the filter *scorecard type* and choose any of the following depending on specific context (*Malaria*, *ALMA Scorecard for Accountability on Action*, *Commonwealth Malaria Tracker*) from the drop-down menu.
- Under the tab country best practices, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *search*, *topic*, *types of best practices*, *country* and *year*. To access best practices for malaria, use the filter *topic*, 2 choices are available: *Malaria scorecard tools* and *End malaria councils* from the drop-down menu.
- The video below demonstrates how to navigate the site:

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

- Some scorecards are shared as pdf files (these are downloadable)

![Rwanda Malaria Scorecard](images/pdf_scorecard.png)

or directly from the web platform (not downloadable, user has to scroll through the file)

![Zambia Malaria Scorecard](images/web_platform%20scorecard.png)

- Scorecards are color coded, the main colors of use are *green (on track)*, *yellow (in progress)*, *red (not on track)*, *grey (not applicable or no data)*, *white (no data)*.
- Scorecards use arrows in combination with the colors, *up arrow (to show an increase)* and *down arrow (to show a decrease)*.
- The ALMA scorecards for accountability and action gives the ALMA scorecard, the Africa Summary report and country specific reports as pdfs in any one of the following languages, *English*, *Arabic*, *Spanish*, *French*, *Swahili* and *Portuguese*.
- Data available is for the years 2015 to 2024.

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

- Downloading the [materials](https://scorecardhub.org/guides-and-toolkits/download-course-content-to-access-when-you-do-not-have-an-internet-connection/) for the online courses is highly beneficial, as they provide a comprehensive overview on how to create scorecards. This will help towards the understanding and interpretation of the scorecards.
- The scorecards are highly country specific, indicators change according to the country's health priorities.

## Working with the data

<h2>How to use this data</h2>

- As indicators vary across countries, it is necessary to check if the indicators of interest are within the available scorecards.
- It is also necessary to check if the country of interest has made the country scorecard available.
- As the scorecards are available in pdf format or as a web platform, information has to be extracted manually.

<h2>Tracking indicator perfomance</h2>

- The plot given below highlights how tracking indicator performance can be achieved.
- Several country performances are highlighted using data obtained from ALMA scorecards for accountability and action.
- The implementation indicator on operational vector control (LLINs/IRS) coverage was considered.
