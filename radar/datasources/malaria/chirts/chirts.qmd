## About the data

Climate Hazards Center InfraRed Temperature with Stations data (CHIRTS), version 1, is a quasi-global (60°S-70°N), land-only, gridded (0.05° and 0.25° degree resolution) of daily maximum and minimum 2-m temperatures dataset, which is referred to as CHIRTS-daily. CHIRTS is created by integrating numerous data sources including satellite imagery, station data, and ERA5 reanalysis to create a gridded temperature time series for the monitoring of temperature extremes. The dataset starts in 1983 and extends to 2016.

For more information regarding CHIRTS datasets see [CHIRTS website](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirtsdaily) or [CHIRTS FAQ](https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRTS_FAQ).
