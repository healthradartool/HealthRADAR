<h2>About the data</h2>

The United Nations Population Division produces and regularly updates estimates of various demographic indicators for 237 countries or areas, covering both historical data and future projections. These estimates and projections are based on available censuses and nationally representative sample surveys.

Indicators such as population size and density, total births and deaths, infant mortality rate, median age and population sex ratio are available. Data for countries and their territories are recorded separately as well as together. Grouped data for continents or groups of countries, states or territories such as "Small Island Developing States (SIDS)" or "Land-locked Countries" is also available.

The data offers comprehensive insights into global demographic trends, supporting policy-making, research, and development initiatives. It's a key resource for understanding historical population changes and projecting future dynamics. For more information regarding the data, visit the [United Nations Population Division](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/) website.

<h2>Accessing the data</h2>

You can access the data by following the instructions below:

1.  Navigate to the UN population division [home page](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/)
2.  Select **Data**, then select **World Population Prospects**.
3.  This will take you to a new page. If you only require a subset of the available data, do the following:
    -   Navigate to **Data** then **Data Portal**.
    -   Choose the desired indicators, locations and years from the dropdown menus, and then press "Search". The resulting page will allow you to view plots of the data.
    -   Navigating to **Table** then **Export** then **CSV** will download the selected data as a CSV file. Be aware that searching a large dataset can take a long time. Using the "Download Center" (Step 4) may be more efficient in this case.
4.  To download the full dataset which we use in this tutorial, select **Data** then **Download Center** from the [World Population Prospects page](https://population.un.org/wpp/). The [webpage](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/) to which you have now navigated provides options for download.
    -   Under the title "Major topic/ Special groupings", select the **"CSV format"** option. Information about the data will be displayed. Scrolling down reveals a table containing links to download various CSV files. For the purposes of this tutorial, the file containing data from the subgroup "Demographic Indicators", labelled "1950-2100, medium (GZ, 15.79 MB)", will be used.

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

This dataset contains estimates or projections for a range of demographic indicators over a broad time period. It is not separated by age and is presented in wide format, with each row providing values for all indicators for a given country or area in a given year.

![Layout of the CSV file opened in Microsoft Excel, displaying nine of 67 columns, and 11 of 84 360 rows.](images/pop_csv.png)

The indicator labels are not all self explanatory. Below is a table which provides slightly more detail for each indicator:

:::{.callout-note icon='false' collapse='true'}

## Indicator description

The label used for each indicator in the dataset of interest, along with a description of this indicator.

```{r}
#| echo: false

labs              <- str_split(read.table("data/indicator_labs.txt")$V1, ",")[[1]][-(1:13)]    # remove location and time vars
detail            <- read.table("data/indicator_detail.txt", sep = "\n")$V1[-1]                # row one is a heading
timeloc           <- read.table("data/time_loc_inds.txt", sep = c(":", "\n"))[-13,] # midperiod not recorded for dataset of interest
colnames(timeloc) <- c("labs", "detail")

table             <- rbind(timeloc, cbind(labs, detail))
colnames(table) <- c("Name", "Description")

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

**Estimations and Projections:**

This dataset uses data from censuses and other surveys to generate estimations of demographic indicators for past and present years, and projections of these same indicators for future years. Estimates and projections become more uncertain further into the future.

**National Level - Ignoring Spatial Heterogeneity:**

Modelling malaria transmission based on population sizes at a national level can overlook important spatial heterogeneities:

-   Regional variations: Malaria transmission can vary significantly between different regions within a country due to differences in population densities and other demographic factors.

-   Local hotspots: Even within regions, there can be local hotspots of malaria transmission due to factors such as population density and human behavior.

-   Population movement: The movement of people between different areas can introduce or reintroduce malaria parasites, affecting transmission dynamics. By only looking at movement of people between countries, we will miss these subnational movements.

While some of the locations for which data are provided are territories, regions or states, there are no countries for which the data can be separated by subregion such as province.

<h2>How to use this dataset</h2>

Long format tables are often easier to work with. Below is a code chunk which converts the dataset as downloaded from the UN Population Division webpage to a longer format, and prints out the `Location`, `Time`, `Indicator` and `Value` columns.


```{r}
# Read in data

                   col_types = "iiccciicicicinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn")

un_pop_long <- un_pop |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = 14:ncol(un_pop), names_to = "Indicator", values_to = "Value") |>
  mutate(Value = Value/1000) # Convert to thousands

un_pop_long |> 
  select(Location, Time, Indicator, Value) |> 
  head(n = 10) |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_options(table.align = "left")
```

## Modelling Example 

<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>

Models aim to provide abstract simulations of real-life dynamics. As such, it is important to include realistic parameters pertaining to birth and death, and the overall growth of the population. Using data from the UN Population Division Data Portal, we use the crude birth and death rates to inform population growth in the example below. While age-specific death rates may be more valuable, we use these as a proxy for average death rates across the population.

### Preparing the data

We plot the values for crude birth and death rates obtained from Mozambique below.

```{r}

crude_births <- read_csv("data/unpopulation_dataportal_births.csv") |>  
  distinct(Time, .keep_all = TRUE) # remove duplicates
crude_deaths <-  read_csv("data/unpopulation_dataportal_deaths.csv")
  
rates <- bind_rows(crude_births, crude_deaths)

rates |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = Time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Value, colour = IndicatorName)) +
  theme_health_radar() +
  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "per 1000 population",
       title = "Crude birth and death rates in Mozambique",
       colour = "Indicator",
       caption = "Birth rates are significantly higher than death reates, as is common in many growing African countries. Source: UN Population Division.")

```

### Changes in human population

Considering malaria immunity increases with age, the introduction of new susceptibles (through the birth rate) can help sustain transmission, and skew the disease burden to younger individuals, i.e. children. In order to factor this in, we show a simple model with no interventions. We assume the vector population remains constant. The [Climate Research Unit Timeseries](https://uct-masha.quarto.pub/healthradar/radar/datasources/malaria/cru-ts/cruts.html) page provides a demonstration of changes to the vector population in the context of disease modeling.
