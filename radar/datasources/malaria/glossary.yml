# Vector insecticide resistance
Insecticide Resistance: |
  The ability of mosquito populations to survive exposure to insecticides that would normally kill them, often due to genetic mutations or metabolic adaptations.

Pyrethroids: |
  A class of synthetic insecticides widely used in malaria control (e.g., in bed nets and sprays) that target mosquito nervous systems.

WHO susceptibility tests: |
  A standardized bioassay to assess mosquito mortality after exposure to a diagnostic dose of insecticide, used to monitor resistance.

# CRU TS
skill: |
  In climate science, the *skill* of a dataset refers to its accuracy, resolution, bias, uncertainty, and predictive power in representing real-world climate conditions. A high-skill dataset closely matches observations, has minimal bias, and reliably supports climate modelling and decision-making.
