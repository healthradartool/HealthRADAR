## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

The global database on invasive mosquito vector species was established in 2019 following the recommendations of the WHO's first Technical Consultation on the spread of *Anopheles stephensi*. The database is designed to allow tracking of the geographical spread of malaria vector species that pose a threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. The database aims to support the evaluation of risks posed by invasive vector species and to promote and inform prompt action to mitigate this risk.

These datasets provide information on long term trends in distribution and spread of new or emerging mosquito vectors of malaria and enable tracking the spread of invasive vector species such as *Anopheles stephensi* comparison between countries. The data provided are on an annual time scale at the national level and would not be suitable for subnational analysis or to explore seasonal trends in malaria.

Tracking surveillance activities helps to understand current research gaps. Knowledge of where studies are either being planned, currently underway, or recently completed, helps to inform where to direct resources for future studies.

<h2>Accessing the data</H2>

The data can be accessed on the Global Malaria Programme page on the WHO website [Malaria Threats Map](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/stories?theme=prevention). The data has a web page which includes useful contextual information as well as additional resources. The data can be viewed in the original report in excel format as it is usually preferable for modelling to have an excel spreadsheet.

To access the data, click on the [link](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats) to access the Malaria Threats Map page. Click on the data download tab. Select the theme Invasive Vector Species to access the Invasive Vector Species detections. Data can be filtered according to species and year (1984-2024) in which collected. Filter can be applied according to location. Follow the prompts to select and download data. The data is downloaded as an Excel file.

The downloaded data can be plotted according to the geography for which the filters were selected (species, year collected and location). At this stage, dashboard summaries are not available for this thematic area.

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

Sometimes the data needs to be prepared before it is able to be plotted.

![Distribution of Anopheles stephensi in Kenya for 2022-2024.](images/distributionn_of_anopheles_stephensi_kenya.png)

The distribution of *An. stephensi* was plotted for all districts in Kenya between 2022-2024. The method employed for collecting the specimens were recorded and the main methods of collection were the dipping method for mosquito larvae and the use of the light trap for collection of adult mosquitoes. The species identification was confirmed using molecular techniques.

**Description**

The data can be viewed as a spreadsheet, plotted on a map to show distribution or as a dashboard giving a summary of epidemiological and entomological data. The data can also be downloaded as Excel documents from the "Download Data" page.

![The occurrence of all invasive species from 2010 â€“ 2024.](images/occurance_of_invasive_species.png)

Figure 2 shows the distribution of all invasive mosquito species in Africa and south-east Asia for the past 14 years. It is apparent that *An. stephensi* is native to south-east Asia but it is an invasive species in north Africa. A number of sites were negative for *An. stephensi*. This information can be used for revising malaria control protocols.

![Sample of the summary dashboard that can be created using the distribution data.](images/summary_dashboard.png)

Figure 3 shows a snap-shot of the summary data that can be generated from the selected dataset with the use of the appropriate filters. In this example, the vectors of Angola are listed and it is evident that *An. stephensi* has not yet moved down along the west coast of Africa. The insecticide resistance status of the vector mosquitoes is also given. The [complete dashboard](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/dashboards?country=AO&theme=prevention) provides more information.

## Visualisations

<h2>How to use this data</h2>

The data contained in the database can be explored through the interactive data visualization platform [Malaria Threats Map](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/surveillance/malaria-threats-map). The platform provides a spreadsheet of the requested data in an Excel format. Distribution maps of the spread of invasive species can be generated from this data. A dashboard of malaria epidemiology and entomology can also be accessed via [this website](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/dashboards?country=AO).

<h2>How to plot this data</h2>

Data has been extracted for Kenya (invasive species) and Angola (Dashboard) . *Anopheles stephensi* has not yet been detected in Angola but it has invaded nearly all districts in Kenya. The absence of *An. stephensi* also indicated that entomological surveillance systems need to be strengthened especially where there is no urban malaria. Surveillance systems for entomology needs to take into account the urban nature of the invasive mosquitoes also its tendency to breed in man-made breeding sites such as in water storage containers and open sewers.
