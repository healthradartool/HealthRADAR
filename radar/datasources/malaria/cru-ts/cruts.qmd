## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

The CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset is a global, high-resolution, land-based climate dataset that provides monthly records on a 0.5° grid. The dataset is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations, offering data from 1901 onwards. This observational dataset consists of ten observed and derived climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation (see Variables list below), making it useful for many classes of users, in diverse research areas and applications and has been widely adopted in research and policy work.

Updated annually, the dataset follows a versioning system. CRU TS v4.08, the latest version released in 2024, reflects both major updates in methodology and minor refinements, extending its temporal coverage and improving data quality, compared to previous versions.

**Strengths and weaknesses**

**Strengths**

-   The dataset is widely used and evaluated.
-   It provides a number of useful variables for malaria modelling.
-   It provides and long and continuous record.

**Limitations**

-   The skill of the dataset relies heavily on the density of the station network. The density over southern Africa is very poor with some areas not having any available stations, or they are are very far away in climatically very different regions.
-   The data is monthly which limits the usefulness of the dataset which may require higher temporal resolution data.
-   The stations come from a number of different networks and they are not strictly homogenized so caution should be use in any trend analysis.

**Notes for users**

CRU provides users with the number of stations used to build each datum within the CRU TS dataset. The NetCDF-formatted (CF-1.4 compliant) CRU TS data output files (for all variables except PET) contain two data variables, the named one, (i.e., ‘tmp’), and a station count (‘stn’) giving the number of stations. If working with ASCII text output files, CRU also publishes a separate station count metadata file. The station counts vary between 0 (no cover, climatology inserted, see Interpolation above), and eight (the maximum station count for interpolation). The ‘stn’ data may be used to quantify uncertainty, most particularly by excluding cells with a 0 (zero) count, as these will have been set to the default climatology. The station count can vary widely through space and time and per variable, see plot xx below.

## Working with the data

<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>

Malaria is a seasonal disease with regular fluctuations in incidence. Even in endemic countries with year-round cases peak during the rainy season (November to April for most southern African countries). During this time, temperature and rainfall conditions favour vector development, thereby increasing the total mosquito population. A few specific variables have been experimentally shown to be temperature-sensitive:

-   The parasite extrinsic incubation period
-   Vector gonotrophic cycle
-   Human biting rate
-   Daily survival/death rate of larval and adult vectors
-   The egg to adult development rate

The egg to adult development rate is also rainfall-sensitive, as is oviposition and the carrying capacity of the environment.

### Seasonal forcing function

Generally, we introduce a forcing function to mimic the seasonal pattern of temperature and rainfall. In this case, we use the cossine function, where $amp$ represents the amplitude of the curve and the strength of the seasonality and $phi$ is the phase angle used to offset the start of the period. It is important to note, however, that this merely represents the overall pattern of environmental conditions.

$$
seas = amp \times (1 + \cos(2 \pi \times time - phi))
$$

### Preparing the data 

Using the CRU TS dataset, we obtain specific values for temperature over time, and model the historic impact of climatology on the vector population and subsequent incidence. We use mean air temperature as a proxy for surface temperatures.

```{r}

#| message: false
#| warning: false

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, cache = T, warning = F, message = F, fig.pos = 'H', cache = T)
options(digits=4, scipen = 9)
```

There are different approaches to explicitly include environmental conditions into an infectious disease model. For this example, we use three equations from Traore (2017) and Agusto (2015; 2020) defining the effect of climate on the dynamics of malaria transmission. Specifically, the example below describes temperature-dependent human biting rate and mosquito mortality, as well as rainfall-dependent environmental carrying capacity.

We incorporate these values into the mathematical model. Note that other models may include other variables such as altitude and humidity.

### Changes in vector population

As mentioned earlier, environmental conditions affect the parasite and mosquito development, and as such we anticipate changes in the vector population to mimic the pattern in the temperature. In this example, we assume the human population stays constant as is shown in the panel on the right. The [UN Population Data portal page](https://jfunction.quarto.pub/healthradar/radar/datasources/malaria/un-population/un_population.html) describes human population growth in the context of disease modelling.

```{r}
df |> 
  filter(variable %in% c("M", "P")) |> 
  mutate(variable = factor(variable,
                           levels = c("M", "P"),
                           labels = c("Mosquitoes", "Humans"))) |>

  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, colour = variable)) +
  #facet_wrap(~variable) +
  theme_health_radar() +
  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +
  theme(panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(suffix = " M", scale = 1e-6)) +
  labs(title = "Mosquito vector and human host Populations over time", 
       x = "Year",
       y = "Population size",
       colour = "Population",
       caption = str_wrap("Changes in the total mosquito population mimic seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall values over time, with peaks in the summer months. The higher rainfall values in 2017 are also reflected in the mosquito population.  The human population remains constant in this example, as it is not driven by environmental conditions. Source: Model output"))

```

### Incidence

The force of infection (i.e. the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected per unit time) is largely driven by the human biting rate, the ratio of vectors relative to hosts, the probability of transmission and the size of the infectious reservoir. Below, we see how the temperature has driven the rate of new cases through the temperature-dependent variables.

This is especially insightful when the model includes periods of time impacted by severe environmental conditions such as drought or flooding, and the consequences on malaria transmission dynamics are reflected in the incidence values.
```{r}

       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of new cases",
      caption = str_wrap("Incidence is highest during the summer months (October to February), where environmental conditions are suitable for mosquito breeding and malaria transmission. Incidence is close to zero between June and September. Source: Model output"))
