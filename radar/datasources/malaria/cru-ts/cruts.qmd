## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

The CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset is a global, high-resolution, land-based climate dataset that provides monthly records on a 0.5° grid. The dataset is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations, offering data from 1901 onwards. This observational dataset consists of ten observed and derived climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation (see Variables list below), making it useful for many classes of users, in diverse research areas and applications and has been widely adopted in research and policy work.

Updated annually, the dataset follows a versioning system. CRU TS v4.08, the latest version released in 2024, reflects both major updates in methodology and minor refinements, extending its temporal coverage and improving data quality, compared to previous versions.

**Strengths and weaknesses**

**Strengths**

-   The dataset is widely used and evaluated.
-   It provides a number of useful variables for malaria modelling.
-   It provides and long and continuous record.

**Limitations**

-   The skill of the dataset relies heavily on the density of the station network. The density over southern Africa is very poor with some areas not having any available stations, or they are are very far away in climatically very different regions.
-   The data is monthly which limits the usefulness of the dataset which may require higher temporal resolution data.
-   The stations come from a number of different networks and they are not strictly homogenized so caution should be use in any trend analysis.

**Notes for users**

CRU provides users with the number of stations used to build each datum within the CRU TS dataset. The NetCDF-formatted (CF-1.4 compliant) CRU TS data output files (for all variables except PET) contain two data variables, the named one, (i.e., ‘tmp’), and a station count (‘stn’) giving the number of stations. If working with ASCII text output files, CRU also publishes a separate station count metadata file. The station counts vary between 0 (no cover, climatology inserted, see Interpolation above), and eight (the maximum station count for interpolation). The ‘stn’ data may be used to quantify uncertainty, most particularly by excluding cells with a 0 (zero) count, as these will have been set to the default climatology. The station count can vary widely through space and time and per variable, see plot xx below.

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

The dataset's skill is very tightly linked to the number of stations that are available for the location and timestep.
