## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

ERA5 is the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset produced by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts), providing a detailed, global view of the climate. Covering the period from 1940 to near real-time, ERA5 combines vast amounts of historical observations with modern weather forecasting models, ensuring a globally complete, physically consistent record. The gridded dataset is available at a high spatial resolution of 0.25° (approximately 28 km by 28 km at the equator, varying slightly by latitude) and offers data at hourly intervals, providing sub-daily time resolution. It includes a wide range of surface and upper-air variables, supporting a broad spectrum of applications and research fields.

ERA5 is continuously updated, with data typically available within about one week of real time. Regular updates and corrections ensure the quality and completeness of the dataset over time.

ECMWF has made several subsets of the ERA5 reanalysis dataset available to meet different user needs. These include distinctions between data provided at pressure levels versus single levels (surface and near-surface variables), and at different temporal resolutions (hourly and monthly averages). For the purposes of this site, we focus on the "ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present" subset, which offers high-resolution, near-surface climate variables suitable for a wide range of applications.

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

ERA5 is a global reanalysis dataset produced by combining model output with a wide range of historical observations using data assimilation techniques. It reflects a blend of satellite, in situ, aircraft, and other observational sources, integrated using the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS). Through this system, vast amounts of observations are brought together into a consistent model framework, resulting in a physically coherent dataset suitable for climate monitoring and research.

The quality and density of observations vary across space and time, particularly in earlier decades and over data-sparse regions. ERA5 provides uncertainty estimates for many variables through ensemble-based statistics, such as the standard deviation from the 10-member ensemble. These can be used as proxies to assess confidence in the data at specific times and locations.

ERA5 data is available at hourly resolution and can be aggregated to daily or monthly time scales. The dataset includes many surface and atmospheric variables, and its sub-daily time resolution supports detailed temporal analysis. It also enables the derivation of additional variables, such as relative humidity, from core fields like air temperature and dew point temperature. The reanalysis is updated daily with only a few days' delay, making it suitable for near-real-time analysis. As a model-observation hybrid, ERA5 offers spatially and temporally complete outputs, which can be particularly valuable in regions or periods with limited direct observations.

Users should be aware that the skill of ERA5 data varies by variable, due to how the dataset is produced. ERA5 is derived from a global climate model with fixed spatial resolution, meaning it represents the Earth using a grid. As a result, it can struggle to accurately capture small-scale ('sub-grid') processes, such as localized convective rainfall (e.g. thunderstorms). Consequently, rainfall data tends to be less skillful, especially in regions dominated by convective processes or with sparse observational coverage. Temperature data, on the other hand, generally has higher skill, as it is strongly constrained by assimilated observations and tends to be more spatially consistent than rainfall. Comparing ERA5 data with local observations is recommended to assess its reliability.

Specific variables in ERA5 are defined and derived in distinct ways:

- The temperature variable '2m temperature' in ERA5 represents the air temperature at two meters above the surface. Over land, near-surface temperature observations from weather stations are combined with the model output to improve accuracy. However, ERA5 does not explicitly represent urban environments, so it may not fully capture the 'urban heat island' effect often observed in cities. Environmental factors such as land type and vegetation also influence the 2 meter temperature. Over the ocean, the 2 meter temperature is strongly influenced by sea surface temperatures (SST), which are derived from a combination of satellite observations (since 1982) and in-situ measurements (prior to 1982). 

- The precipitation variable 'total precipitation' in ERA5 includes all forms of precipitation (e.g. rain, snow, sleet, and hail). Unlike temperature, precipitation observations are not directly used to adjust the model so the data reflects the model's best estimate based on its representation of physical processes. However, ERA5's precipitation is influenced by other observations, such as satellite measurements of humidity in the atmosphere. ERA5 precipitation estimates rely heavily on parameterizations (simplified equations) to represent small-scale ('sub-grid') processes like thunderstorms, which can reduce accuracy in certain regions.

- The wind vector variables '10m u-component' and '10m v-component' in ERA5 represent the U (east-west) and V (north-south) wind components 10 meters above the surface. These variables are not directly predicted by the model and are calculated from the model’s surface and atmospheric conditions outputs. Observational data is combined with the model outputs to provide the best estimate of near-surface wind conditions.

<h3>Strengths</h3>

- Provides a consistent, physically-based reconstruction of weather and climate over time.
- Offers hourly data since 1940, allowing analysis at high temporal resolution.
- Covers a wide range of variables, useful for many climate-health applications, including malaria modelling.
- Includes ensemble-based uncertainty estimates for many parameters.


<h3>Limitations</h3>

- The accuracy of ERA5 depends on the quality and availability of assimilated observations, which are limited in some regions and periods (especially before the satellite era or over data-sparse regions like parts of Africa).
- It is not an observational dataset but a model–observation hybrid; as such, it may smooth or misrepresent localized extremes or fine-scale variability.
- Can be complex and data-intensive to work with.

## Visualisations  

<h2>How to plot this data?</h2>

In this example, we demonstrate how to visualise ERA5 data using the [ERA Explorer](https://era-explorer.climate.copernicus.eu) application provided by [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu). The ERA Explorer application allows users to explore the historical climate for anywhere on earth using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset and focuses on four key variables, temperature, rainfall, wind and humidity, all of which are important for Malaria modelling. In the below example we will focus on two different locations in southern Africa.

:::{.cell}
![Fig. 1: ERA Explorer Landing page ](images/Vis_Fig1_ERA-Explorer_homepage.png)

Users can select a location of interest by clicking on the global interactive map. The application then calculates a set of climate statistics for the selected grid cell (0.25° x 0.25° resolution), which are displayed as a series of plots. These plots can be downloaded as PNG images, and the underlying data can be downloaded in CSV format. The site also links to example Python notebooks to help users understand, replicate, or customize the code.

    Note: The data represents average conditions for the entire grid cell, not the precise local environment. 

A guidance section, accessible via the "?" icon, provides information on how to use the app; the organisation, the ERA5 dataset and about the data, and how to interpret the plots presented in the app.

The ERA Explorer provides several types of visualisations which include:

- Monthly climatologies (temperature, rainfall and relative humidity)
- Annual timeseries (temperature and rainfall)
- Annual anomalies (temperature)
- Daily climatologies (temperature)
- Hourly climatologies (wind)

Each plot is generated automatically, with a brief explanation below describing the method used. While most plots look straightforward, some involve complex processing—particularly those showing relative humidity or hourly wind climatologies.

If users wish to generate their own plots, it is recommended to download the data from the application and to refer to the example python notebooks provided.
