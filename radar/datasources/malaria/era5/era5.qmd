## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) reanalysis for the global climate and weather. The ERA5 reanalysis dataset covers the period 1940 to near real-time and combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. The gridded (0.25° resolution) data is available in 1-hour timesteps.

For more information regarding ERA5 datasets see [ERA5-Dataset Documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5).
