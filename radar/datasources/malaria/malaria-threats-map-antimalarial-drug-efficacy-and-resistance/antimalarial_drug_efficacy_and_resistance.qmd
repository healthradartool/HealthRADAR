## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

The global database on antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance was initiated in 2000 to centralize data and facilitate reporting on the status of antimalarial drug efficacy in malaria endemic countries.

The WHO global database on antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance contains data from therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) conducted on *P. falciparum*, *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, *P. malariae* and *P. knowlesi*, as well as molecular marker studies of *P. falciparum* drug resistance. TES are mainly done using first- and second-line treatment as well as treatments considered for introduction into the treatment policy.

The datasets cover the period from 2010 to 2023. The data is based on antimalarial drug efficacy which is being monitored through therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) across Africa, Asia and South America. The TES track clinical and parasitological outcomes among patients receiving antimalarial treatment. TES are considered the gold standard by which countries can best determine their national treatment policies.

**Molecular markers of antimalarial drug resistance data**

The database also includes data on the geographical distribution of molecular markers associated with *P. falciparum* drug resistance, including:

-   *PfKelch13* (artemisinin resistance)
-   *Pfplasmepsin 2-3* copy number (piperaquine resistance)
-   *Pfmdr1* copy number (mefloquine resistance)
-   *Pfcrt* in Mesoamerica (chloroquine resistance)

<h2>Accessing the data</h2>

Data on TES performed in compliance with the WHO standard protocol for tracking the effectiveness of antimalarial drugs are included inthe database.The year in the database is the year the study started,since study durations frequently span two calendar years. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) correction is employed in studies with a minimum follow-up duration of 28 days to differentiate treatment failures resulting from recrudescence from reinfection.

The protocol approach is used to calculate treatment failure rates. Only patients who finish the whole trial follow-up and have a definite outcome—a therapy failure or success—are included in this analysis. Patients who discontinue their participation in the trial, do not follow up, or withdraw are not included in the analysis. Treatment failure rates using the Kaplan-Meier analysis are provided when available.

The most recent report may not contain all years of estimates. 

The website also provides access to maps on antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance. The maps allow you to explore individual studies and site-level data for all the threats. The maps are updated regularly and data up to site level is available for most countries. The maps allow you to generate graphs by clicking onto it.

The maps can be accessed on the [Malaria Threats Map](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats) website.

The website has [dashboards](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/dashboards) that allows the end user to view summaries of the threats at different geographical levels. The data is available at country and area level. End users may select up to 5 countries/area per report.

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

**Description**

Data from the most recent TES are summarized in the reports. A comprehensive summary of treatment failure rates broken down by treatment and country is offered using the interactive reports. Therapeutic outcomes are assessed on the final day of the study (day 28, or day 42 for drugs with longer elimination half-lives). For infections appearing during follow-up, genotyping must be conducted to distinguish new infections from recrudescence.

Data are available for each country and annually. Some datasheets contain a few years of data, while others report data for the most recent year.

A sample of the data is shown below. The table summarizes the treatment failure rates among patients infected with *P. malariae*. The displayed data is grouped by country and treatment.

## Visualisations

<h2>How to use this data?</h2>

Evaluating trends in antimalarial drug resistance and communicating the results to a broad audience are important for dealing with the drug resistance threat.

As part of its normative function, WHO creates standard procedures to track the effectiveness, resistance, and prevention of antimalarial drugs and offers nations financial and technical support to put these protocols into practice. The [Malaria Threats Map](https://www.who.int/activities/monitoring-malaria-drug-efficacy-and-resistance#cms) is derived from a global database containing the findings of various investigations. Updates to national policies for first- and second-line therapies for malaria are also influenced by these studies.

Download the data from the link and read in a sheet. Sometimes the data needs to be prepared before it is able to be plotted. The data can be saved for use.

A stacked bar plot is a useful way of visualising a total value that is made up of a number of contributions. Here, the total number of patients that completed a MTM therapeutic efficacy study per year between 2010 and 2021 are visualised, with the contributions from each of four of the E8 countries highlighted.

```{r}

A lollipop plot can be used to visualise the percentage of patients who experienced treatment failure on different drugs, in different countries. A problem is encountered, however, if multiple trials in the same country had the same percentage of patients with treatment failure. Jittering is used to solve this problem, which decreases the visual appeal but ensures that important information is not obscured.

```{r}
library(stringr)

# Set seed to ensure identical jittering every time the plot is built
set.seed(18)

dat_trt_pp |> 
  # Filter the data to include only rows where Value is not NA and YEAR_END is 2015

## Modelling Example 

<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>

```{r, echo = FALSE}

library(readxl)
library(EnvStats)
library(tidyverse)
library(deSolve)

```


Therapeutic efficacy studies assess how well antimalarial drugs clear infections and are an indicator of treatment success. Case management with Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACTs) is a critical part of any country's control strategy, and as such, representing it accurately in the disease model is key. Twenty therapeutic efficacy studies following treatment with Artemether-lumefantrine were done in Zimbabwe between 2010 and 2017. We use these to inform the treatment dynamics in the health system.

### Preparing the data

We calculate the mean probability of treatment failure in each year to inform the model.

```{r}

# Load the data
therapeutic_eff_data <- read_excel("data/MTM_THERAPEUTIC_EFFICACY_STUDY_20250324.xlsx",
           sheet = 2) |>  
  mutate(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP = as.numeric(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP)/100)

# Calculate mean probability of treatment failure over time
mean_pf <- therapeutic_eff_data |> 
  group_by(YEAR_END) |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP)) |>  
  mutate(time = c(365*10, 365*15, 365*18)) # to get time series for 2010, 2014 and 2017 with simulation beginning in 2000

therapeutic_eff_data |>  
  ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(YEAR_END), y = TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour = as.factor(YEAR_END)), outlier.shape = NA) +
  stat_summary(aes(colour = "Mean"), fun = mean) +
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = as.factor(YEAR_END)), width = 0.15) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_health_radar() +
  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +
  labs(title = "Patients with treatment failure in Zimbabwe",
       subtitle = str_wrap("Data from 20 Therapeutic Efficacy Studies"),
       x = "Year",
       y = "Proportion that failed treatment",
       colour = "Year and Variable", 
       caption = str_wrap("Median and Interquartile values from study results indicated by boxplot. We see that mean treatment failure is decreasing over time, from 3% in 2010 to almost 0% in 2017. Source: Malaria Threats Map."))
  
```


### Model assumptions

Using a simple model, we demonstrate how treatment failure is incorporated, and plot the values for incidence. We start with the time-dependent parameter $pf(t)$ for treatment failure among patients infected with *Plasmodium falciparum* in Zimbabwe. We assume that patients are treated, experience treatment failure and express clinical symptoms again within the study follow up period of 28 days (see parameters for $r$ and $sigma$).

```{r}

# Time points for the simulation
Y = 22 # Years of simulation
times <- seq(0, 365*Y, 1) # time in days

# Create a time-dependent function for treatment failure
pf_function <- approxfun(mean_pf$time, mean_pf$mean, rule = 2)  # linear interpolation

### Exploring uncertainty

To account for the uncertainty in the probability of treatment failure $pf$, we sample the value from a triangular distribution and explore the range of the runs.

```{r}

library(triangle)
library(lhs)


set.seed(123)
runs <- 50
results_list <- vector("list", runs)

# Latin Hypercube Sample matrix across 3 years for 50 runs
lhs_matrix <- randomLHS(runs, 3)

# Run simulations
for (i in 1:runs) {
  
  # Summarise treatment failure stats by year
  # Assume mode to be the mean for triangular distribution sampling
  pf_data <- therapeutic_eff_data |> 
    group_by(YEAR_END) |> 
    summarise(
      min = min(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP), 
      mode = mean(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP),
      max = max(TREATMENT_FAILURE_PP),
      .groups = "drop"
    )
  
  # Time durations (in days) from start of simulation
  # Sample values probability of treatment failure from a triangular distribution for each year
  pf_data <- pf_data |>

### Policy implications

Treatment failure and antimalarial drug resistance can lead to prolonged infectious periods, recrudescence, or higher onward transmission, all of which increase the burden on the health system. Policymakers may need to evaluate the performance of first- and second-line therapies based off of surveillance and other insights from therapeutic efficacy studies, and perhaps recommend changes to treatment guidelines such as the use of triple ACTs or monotherapies.
