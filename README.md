**Health RADAR** is a platform that makes it easier to find and use data for Climate Sensitive Infectious Disease (CSID) modelling, with a primary focus on malaria in Southern Africa. The platform provides extensive documentation that describes and contextualises each dataset, offers worked code examples on how to incorporate data into CSID models and directs users to the original data sources where they can download the data.

## Project Overview

One of the greatest obstacles to CSID modelling in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) is accessibility to operationalisable datasets. While much data may be publicly available, it often lacks proper documentation, context and examples for effective integration into disease models. Health RADAR addresses this gap by curating datasets with comprehensive documentation and worked examples.

## Data Categories

Health RADAR curates datasets across multiple domains essential for CSID modelling:

- **Climate & Environmental Data**
- **Epidemiological Data**
- **Demographic & Population Data**
- **Entomological Data**
- **Health System & Intervention Data**

## Data Quality Standards

All datasets included in Health RADAR adhere to the following principles:

- `A` ccessible: Data is available and accessible to users
- `B` efitting: Technically audited to ensure alignment with CSID modelling needs
- `C` ited: Proper attribution and citation information provided
- `D` ocumented: Comprehensive documentation of collection methods and context
- `E` xemplified: Code examples for integration into CSID models
