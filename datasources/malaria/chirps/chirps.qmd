## About the data

Climate Hazards Center InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS), version 2, is a 40+ year quasi-global (50°S-50°N), land-only, gridded (0.05° and 0.25° degree resolution) rainfall dataset. CHIRPS is created by integrating several data sources including 0.05° resolution satellite imagery and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring. The dataset starts in 1981 and extends to the near-present day.

For more information regarding CHIRPS datasets see [CHIRPS-website](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) or [CHIRPS FAQ](https://wiki.chc.ucsb.edu/CHIRPS_FAQ).
