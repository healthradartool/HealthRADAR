## About the data

Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-Series (TS) of high-resolution gridded data of month-by-month variation in climate. Global land coverage (all land areas excluding Antarctica) at 0.5° resolution.

For more information regarding all CRU datasets see [CRU-data](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/)
