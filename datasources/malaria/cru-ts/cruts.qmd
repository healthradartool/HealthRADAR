## About the data

Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Time-Series (TS) of high-resolution gridded data of month-by-month variation in climate. Global land coverage (all land areas excluding Antarctica) at 0.5° resolution.

For more information regarding all CRU datasets see [CRU-data](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/)

### Strengths and weaknesses

#### Notes for users

The dataset is updated each year (with a few months delay). Each year the dataset is given a new version number.

Data for each variable is provided with a supplementary variable 'stn' which lists the number of stations (0 - 8) that were used to determine the value at each grid point for each timestep. This info is key to understanding the skill of the dataset and it varies widely through space and time and per variable.

## Accessing the data

### Guidance and metadata

Via Climate Data Guide: [CRU TS Gridded precipitation and other meteorlogical variables since 1901](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/cru-ts-gridded-precipitation-and-other-meteorological-variables-1901)

Via Climate Data Store: [Temperature and precipitation gridded data for global and regional domains derived from in-situ and satellite observations](https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional?tab=overview)

### Data download

Via The Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia [CRU TS v4.08](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg): latest version (currently v4.08 1901 - 2023), but full global dataset has to be downloaded.


Via Climate Data Store: [Temperature and precipitation gridded data for global and regional domains derived from in-situ and satellite observations](https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional?tab=overview): older version (currently v4.03 1901 - 2019), spatial and temporal subsetting available. Data provided in NetCDF format

Via KNMI Climate Explorer: [Monthly observations](https://climexp.knmi.nl/selectfield_obs2.cgi?id=someone@somewhere): older version (currently v4.07 1901 - 2020), gridpoint, average area or generated subset (eg shapefile). Data provided in NetCDF, csv format.

### What does the data look like

#### Spatial plots of key variables

**Key example plots for a selected location**

- seasonal cycle
- skill assessment / number of stations through time
- time series

## Key points to consider

The dataset's skill is very tightly linked to the number of stations that are available for the location and timestep.

### Terms of use

The various datasets on the CRU website are provided for all to use, provided the sources are acknowledged. Acknowledgment should preferably be by citing one or more of the papers referenced. The website can also be acknowledged if deemed necessary.
