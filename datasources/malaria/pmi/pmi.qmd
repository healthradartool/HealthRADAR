## Overview

<h2>About the data</h2>

The U.S. Government's focal point for the global fight against malaria, the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative has helped save millions of lives and contributed to substantial gains in education, productivity, and economic development. PMI started as a five-year initiative with the goal of reducing malaria deaths by 50% in 15 African countries. Thanks to the bipartisan support of Congress and the generosity of the American people, PMI now works in 24 partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa and three programs in the Greater Mekong Subregion in Southeast Asia--representing about 90% of the global malaria burden. PMI delivers cost-effective, life-saving malaria interventions alongside catalytic technical and operational assistance to equip and empower partner countries to end malaria.

<h2>Accessing the data</h2>

Information on PMI's life-saving malaria interventions and operational support to partner countries is available on the [PMI website](https://www.pmi.gov) 

• Under the "Where We Work" tab from the website, fact sheets for the 27 partner countries can be accessed in PDF format. You can right click on the country's name to access the country's fact sheet, yearly Malaria Operational Plans and download them.

• Under the "Impact" tab, data on malaria burden, PMI funding, PMI commodity investment and the program's impact across partner countries are presented through an interactive map or illustrative graph. This map allows users to hover over individual countries to access detailed information on malaria cases, deaths, and associated metrics. Aside this, filters are also available to select the region or the country and sliders to select the year.

• In the "Resources" section, annual reports, comprehensive one-year Malaria Operational Plans (MOPs), technical documents, and reports detailing interventions in each partner country by year are available for download in PDF format. A search can be refined through the use of filters. The filters are for Technical areas, countries and dates.

<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>

The data are provided for each country on an annual basis and can be accessed through an interactive map or graphical representations. However, no downloadable Excel or CSV files are available. Users must manually extract the data from the map or graph in order to generate Excel or CSV files, should they wish to conduct analyses beyond those available on the website. The following examples illustrate the provided information.

<h2>Key points to consider</h2>

On the PMI's website, the data are provided for each country on an annual basis and can be accessed through an interactive map or graphical representations.

- The data is sourced mostly from the World Malaria Report (WMR) 
 
- Download Options: There are no downloadable Excel or CSV files available.
 
- Manual Data Extraction: Users need to manually extract data from the map or graph to create Excel or CSV files for further analysis.
 
- Yearly data might overlook the seasonal trends in malaria transmission, which are affected by variables like rainfall, temperature, and vectors abundance. This can result in either an overestimation or underestimation of the disease burden and the effectiveness of interventions.

- Behavioral Changes: Changes in population behaviors, such as increased mobility, changes in agricultural practices, or urbanization, can influence transmission dynamics but may not be captured in annual data.

## Visualisations

<h2>How to use this data</h2>


```{r}
# Load packages ####
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)

source(here::here("theme_health_radar.R"))
```

Annual malaria incidence in different countries over time can be easily visualised using line plots. The points plotted at each data point help to communicate that these are annual data, rather than continuous. 

```{r}
incidence_pmi <- read_excel("data/malaria_incidence_PMI.xlsx")

# Reshape the data from wide to long format
incidence_long <- incidence_pmi |>
  pivot_longer(cols = -Country, names_to = "Year", values_to = "Incidence") |>
  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))  # Convert Year to numeric for plotting

# Convert 'Incidence' to numeric
incidence_long$Incidence <- as.numeric(as.character(incidence_long$Incidence))

# Create a ggplot object with incidence_long data
ggplot(incidence_long, aes(x = Year, y = Incidence, color = Country, group = Country)) +
  # Add lines connecting data points for each country

Zambia’s incidence initially increases until 2014, after which it starts to decline. In Angola, malaria incidence shows an initial decline from 2009 to 2012, followed by a steady rise peaking in 2021, indicating a worsening malaria burden over time.

  )

## Modelling

<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>

The data available on the PMI website is valuable for malaria modelling in several ways. It includes indicators that can help in predicting the spread of malaria, assessing the impact of interventions, or understanding regional differences in malaria dynamics. Below are some of the indicators:

- Estimated malaria incidence per year in each of the partner countries
 
- Estimated malaria mortality rate per year in each of the partner countries

- Percentage of children under 5 who slept under a long-lasting insecticide treated net (LLIN) the night before the survey before and after PMI's intervention

- Percentage of pregnant women who received at least three doses of preventive treatment during their last pregnancy before and after PMI's intervention

- PMI's funding in each country. 

In the simple example below, we obtain data on Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) access and usage rates in Angola, and assess the impact of these intervention on malaria cases. IPTp is intended to prevent malaria infection by providing pregnant women with three doses of an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). In turn, this prevents risks associated with pregnancy-related complications caused by malaria infection, such as maternal anemia and low birth weights.

### Model assumptions

 - The total population size remains constant over time and mosquito populations are asusmed to be at equilibrium.

 -  Based on the data obtained from PMI, 19% of women are receiving IPTp in Angola. After three years we incorporate a potential policy change that increases coverage to 50 and/or 70%, respectively. 
 
 -  All IPTp doses are completed and the intervention is 100% effective. IPTp reduces the likelihood of infection and further infectiousness, and also shortens the time to recovery after an infection.
 
 -  0.02% of the Angolan population are women of reproductive age [WHO data](https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing/indicator-explorer-new/MCA/women-of-reproductive-age-(15-49-years)-population-(thousands)). 
 
 -  The fertility rate $f$ is defined as the average number of births per woman over her lifetime. The average childbearing years span from 15 to 45 years of age. $f$ is assumed to be constant over time, and applies uniformly to all susceptible women.

**Force of infection**

The force of infection is typically expressed in terms of the number of new infections per susceptible individual per unit of time. It is often represented as a function of various factors, including malaria transmission dynamics, the prevalence of infection within the population, and specific interventions aimed at reducing transmission. In this example, the force of infection includes a seasonal forcing function, and current coverage levels of IPTp. For a more detailed explanation of seasonal forcing and the impact of weather dynamics on malaria transmission, please see the [Climate Research Unit Timeseries (CRU TS)](https://jfunction.quarto.pub/healthradar/radar/datasources/malaria/cru-ts/cruts.html) page. This example also extends other models on this website by demonstrating three scenarios of IPTp coverage.

### Implications for transmission and incidence

Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp) reduces the number of infections in pregnant women, who are an otherwise vulnerable reservoir for malaria parasites. IPTp is often used in conjunction with other interventions such as ITNs, however, in this example we demonstrate the impact of scenarios of increasing IPTp coverage on incidence.

```{r}
# Plot new malaria cases (cases) over time for each IPTp scenario

    caption = str_wrap("This graph demonstrates that higher IPTp coverage levels significantly reduces malaria incidence over time. With increasing coverage from 19% to 70% in 2018, the incidence of malaria steadily declines in the total population (including amongst women who are not pregnant, as well as men and children). This highlights the importance of widespread IPTp uptake in lowering the overall disease burden.  Source: Model output"),
