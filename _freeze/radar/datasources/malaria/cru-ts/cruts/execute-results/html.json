The dataset is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations, offering data from 1901 onwards. This observational dataset consists of ten observed and derived climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation (see Variables list below), making it useful for many types of users, in diverse research areas and applications and has been widely adopted in research and policy work.\n\nUpdated annually, the dataset follows a versioning system, CRU TS vX.YY. Where 'X' reflects major updates in methodology and 'YY' indicates minor refinements, extending its temporal coverage and improving data quality, compared to previous versions.\n\nFor more information regarding all CRU datasets see [CRU-data](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/)\n\nUsers can also find more information about the CRU dataset here:\n\n- Climate Data Guide: [CRU TS Gridded precipitation and other meteorological variables since 1901](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/cru-ts-gridded-precipitation-and-other-meteorological-variables-1901)\n\n- Climate Data Store: [Temperature and precipitation gridded data for global and regional domains derived from in-situ and satellite observations](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/insitu-gridded-observations-global-and-regional?tab=overview)\n\n\n\n**Summary**\n\n| | |\n--- | --- |\n| **Name** | CRU TS |\n| **Version** | Check for lastest version [here](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/) |\n| **Institution** | [CRU](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/climatic-research-unit) |\n| **Product type** | gridded observed |\n| **Domain** | global land (excluding Antarctica) |\n| **Resolution** |  0.5° x 0.5° (~55.5km x ~55.5km) |\n| **Period** | 1901-recent |\n| **Frequencies** | monthly |\n| **Variables** | precipitation, temperature, others  |\n| **Update frequency** | annual |\n\n\n\n<br/>\n**Variables**\n<br/>\n\n| **Variable Name** | **Variable Description** | **Units** |\n| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------- |\n| cld   | cloud cover                                        \t| percentage (%)      \t|\n| dtr   | diurnal 2-meter temperature range                  \t| degrees Celsius     \t|\n| frs   | frost day frequency                                \t| days                \t|\n| pet   | potential evapo-transpiration                      \t| millimetres per day \t|\n| pre   | precipitation rate                                 \t| millimetres per month   |\n| tmp   | monthly average daily mean 2-meter temperature     \t| degrees Celsius     \t|\n| tmn   | monthly average daily minimum 2-meter temperature  \t| degrees Celsius     \t|\n| tmx   | monthly average daily maximum 2-meter temperature  \t| degrees Celsius     \t|\n| vap   | vapour pressure                                    \t| hectopascals (hPa)  \t|\n| wet   | wet day frequency                                  \t| days                \t|\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<h2>Accessing the data</h2>\n\nCRU is a widely used dataset and can be downloaded from several different platforms.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n### Data Creator\nThe [Climatic Research Unit (CRU)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/climatic-research-unit) at the University of East Anglia is the creator of this dataset. Users can download it directly from their [website](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/), which lists all available datasets, with the most recent version listed at the top. When downloading from CRU, the file provided are for the full global dataset and are available in both ASCII and NetCDF formats.

The NetCDF-formatted ([CF-1.4](http://cfconventions.org/) compliant) CRU TS data output files (for all variables except PET) contain two data variables, the named one, (i.e., ‘tmp’), and a station count (‘stn’) giving the number of stations. If working with ASCII text output files, CRU also publishes a separate station count metadata file. The station counts vary between 0 (no cover, climatology inserted, see Interpolation above), and eight (the maximum station count for interpolation). The ‘stn’ data may be used to quantify uncertainty, most particularly by excluding cells with a zero count, as these will have been set to the default climatology ((i.e., long-term average values from a reference period when no observations are available). The station count can vary widely through space and time and per variable, see figures 4 and 5 above.\n\n\n<h3>Strengths</h3>\n\n- The dataset is widely used and evaluated.\n- It provides a number of useful variables for malaria modelling.\n- It provides and long and continuous record.\n\n<h3>Limitations</h3>\n\n- The skill of the dataset relies heavily on the density of the station network. The density over southern Africa is very poor with some areas not having any available stations, or they are are very far away in climatically very different regions.\n- The data is monthly which limits the usefulness of the dataset which may require higher temporal resolution data.\n- The stations come from a number of different networks and they are not strictly homogenized so caution should be use in any trend analysis.\n\n<h2>Citing the data</h2>\n\nHarris, I., Osborn, T.J., Jones, P. et al.

The CRU TS can be found under the different variables and in this visualisation example we will focus on the data listed under the variables Tmax (daily maximum temperature). \n\nUsers can select the data at different spatial resolutions (0.5°, 1.0°, 2.5°). A metadata variable #/value is also available, indicating the number of weather stations used to calculate each gridcell’s value, ranging from 0 to 8 stations.\n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 2: KNMI Climate Explorer Monthly Observation list of datasets](images/fig2_CRU_KNMI_clim_exp_select_mon_field.png)\n:::\n\nWe select the most recent [Tmax CRU TS 4.08 (land) dataset at 0.5° spatial resolution](https://climexp.knmi.nl/select.cgi?id=&field=cru4_tmx).

Including:\n\n- Spatial and temporal subsetting\n- Monthly high/low-pass filtering\n- Year-on-year high/low-pass filtering\n- Regridding to a lower spatial or temporal resolution\n- Computing of anomalies from a climatological mean, or from zonal mean.\n- It also provides a link to download the dataset itself (though it recommends that users rather utilise the authoritative site).\n\nFor our purposes, we generate an area average for a spatial subset for the Mopani District, Limpopo Province, South Africa by specifying the latitude and longitude bounds.\n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 3: KNMI Climate Explorer tools used to create the spatial subset.](images/fig3_CRU_KNMI_clim_exp_field.png)\n:::\n\nThe output includes:\n\n- A times series\n- The annual cycle\n- Anomalies relative to the annual cycle.\n\nThe site generates basic plots of the output, that can be downloaded either in eps or pdf format. The data itself can be downloaded as the raw data (txt format) or as a netcdf file. Both formats include detailed metadata along with the data itself.\n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 4: KNMI Climate Explorer time page presenting the time series output.](images/fig4_CRU_KNMI_clim_exp_time_series.png)\n:::\n\n\n<h2>How to plot this data?</h2>\n\nThe downloaded time series can be used for various analyses and visualisations.  \n\nIn this example, we perform a simple sanity check on the data by exploring the variability and trends in the climate over the historical period for the Mopani District.  Specifically, we present annual anomalies for daily maximum and daily minimum temperature and rainfall.\n\n<h3>Analysis steps</h3>\n\n1) **Calculation of annual mean or total values** for daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall.\n    - We use a July–June year to align with the malaria season, which primarily occurs in summer.\n2) **Calculate the average (baseline) climate** for the 30-year period 1981-2010. \n    - This is a standard climatological baseline and corresponds with relatively complete station coverage globally.\t\n3) **Compute anomalies** by subtracting the baseline from each year’s value.\n4) **Include the metadata #/value (station count)** as an annual average to provide an indication of the data quality across the record.\n\n<h3>Interpretation and discussion</h3>\n\n- **Daily Maximum Temperature (Tmax):** The average is 29°C (Fig. 5). The time series shows considerable year-to-year variability and an overall warming trend.\n- **Daily Minimum Temperature (Tmin):**  The average is 15.6°C (Fig. 6). Similarly, there is variability and a suggested warming trend.\n- **Annual Rainfall:** The mean total rainfall is approximately 532 mm. The record shows strong interannual variability with multi-year wet or dry spells, but no clear long-term trend.\n\n**Note**: South Africa historically maintained dense rainfall, and to a lesser extent temperature, station networks operated by the South African Weather Service, the Agricultural Research Council and other organisations. The data for these networks were combined and made freely available in 2000. This is the key reason for the high density of stations being utilized in the CRU dataset during the period 1904 - 2001 for rainfall and for 1951-2001 for the temperatures. The number of operational weather stations has decreased significantly during the last few decades and only a few of these stations make their data available to be used in datasets like CRU.\n\n<h3>Advice to users</h3>\n\nIn this example, the user is advised not to use the temperature data for the period pre-1951 since very few station records are used to calculate the values. Also, there are no other sources of observed climate data against which to evaluate the skill of this dataset during this period. The data for most recent decades should be used with caution and the user is advised to evaluate the dataset against other available datasets.\n\nThe rainfall dataset may be used since the maximum number of stations are utilised for the majority of the period. Rainfall, and especially convective rainfall, is highly localized and episodic. Therefore the proximity of the stations to the target location is far more critical in comparison to temperature which is far more spatially and temporally consistent. CRU does not provide the exact location of the stations and therefore it is still advised to evaluate the dataset against other datasets, especially for the more recent decades. \n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 5: CRU TS annual (July - June) average daily maximum temperature anomalies and number of stations for the Mopani District (average gridcell values for domain lon 30 - 32, lat -24.5 - -23) for the period 1901-2023. ](images/fig5_CRU_TimeSeries_TemperatureMax-Anomalies_Annua.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 6: CRU TS annual (July - June) average daily minimum temperature anomalies and number of stations for the Mopani District (average gridcell values for domain lon 30 - 32, lat -24.5 - -23) for the period 1901-2023.](images/fig6_CRU_TimeSeries_TemperatureMin-Anomalies_Annual.png)\n:::\n\n:::{.cell}\n![Fig. 7: CRU TS annual (July - June) total rainfall anomalies (%) and number of stations for the Mopani District (average gridcell values for domain lon 30 - 32, lat -24.5 - -23) for the period 1901-2023.](images/fig7_CRU_TimeSeries_Rainfall-Anomalies_Annual.png)\n:::\n\nThe CRU TS mean annual total rainfall over this Mopani District is around 532 mm. It shows strong year to year variability, with some longer periods of above or below average rainfall. No clear trends in the rainfall are evident. \n\nSouth Africa historically had an extensive rainfall station network and this is evidenced by the maximum number of stations being used to calculate this dataset for this region from 1904 - 2001. The decrease in station count post 2001 is due to both the reduction in active weather stations, but also in the number of stations that make their data available for use in datasets like CRU TS. The user is advised to evaluate the dataset against other datasets, especially for the more recent decades. \n\n \n\n## Modelling Example \n\n<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>\n\nMalaria is a seasonal disease with regular fluctuations in incidence. Even in endemic countries with year-round cases peak during the rainy season (November to April for most southern African countries). During this time, temperature and rainfall conditions favour vector development, thereby increasing the total mosquito population. A few specific variables have been experimentally shown to be temperature-sensitive (Shapiro 2017; Suh 2024):\n\n-   The parasite extrinsic incubation period\n-   Vector gonotrophic cycle\n-   Human biting rate\n-   Daily survival/death rate of larval and adult vectors\n-   The egg to adult development rate\n\nThe egg to adult development rate is also rainfall-sensitive, as is oviposition and the carrying capacity of the environment.\n\n\n### Preparing the data \n\nUsing the CRU TS dataset, we obtain specific values for temperature over time, and model the historic impact of climatology on the vector population and subsequent incidence. We use mean air temperature as a proxy for surface temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are different approaches to explicitly include environmental conditions into an infectious disease model. For this example, we use three equations from Traore (2017) and Agusto (2015; 2020) defining the effect of climate on the dynamics of malaria transmission. Specifically, the example below describes temperature-dependent human biting rate and mosquito mortality, as well as rainfall-dependent environmental carrying capacity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data \ntemperature_values <- read_csv(\"data/tas_mon_CRU_TS-4.08_190101-202312_Bulawayo.csv\") |> \n  select(time, tas) |> \n  mutate(tas = tas-273) |> #convert from Kelvin to Celsius\n  filter(time >= ymd(\"2010-01-01\") & time <= ymd(\"2020-12-31\")) # start date of data\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = temperature_values, aes(x = time, y = tas), colour = theme_health_radar_colours[13]) +\n  geom_point(data = temperature_values, aes(x = time, y = tas), colour = theme_health_radar_colours[13]) +\n  theme_health_radar() +\n  labs(\n    title = str_wrap(\"Average Mean Surface Air Temperature values in Bulawayo from 2000 to 2020\", width = 50),\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Temperature values (Celsius °)\",\n    caption = str_wrap(\"Changes in temperature over time.

In this example, we assume the human population stays constant as is shown in the panel on the right. The [UN Population Data portal page](https://uct-masha.quarto.pub/healthradar/radar/datasources/malaria/un-population/un_population.html) describes human population growth in the context of disease modelling. In this example, we assume that the human population remains constant, and that humans can be exposed to and infected by an infectious mosquito while recovering from an initial infection (secondary infection).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf |> \n  filter(variable == \"M\") |> \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = value, colour = variable)) +\n  theme_health_radar() +\n  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +\n  theme(panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(suffix = \" M\", scale = 1e-6)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mosquito vector populations over time\", \n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Population size\",\n    colour = \"Population\",\n    caption = str_wrap(\"Changes in the total mosquito population mimic seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall values over time, with peaks in the summer months.

Below, we see how the temperature has driven the rate of new cases through the temperature-dependent variables.\n\nThis is especially insightful when the model includes periods of time impacted by severe environmental conditions such as drought or flooding, and the consequences on malaria transmission dynamics are reflected in the incidence values.

This can be used to enable early warning systems for malaria outbreaks, as well as for temporal planning of interventions such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) for maximum impact. This approach also promotes multidisciplinary collaboration for policymakers across health, environmental, and climate sciences.\n\n\n### Citations\n\n-   Agusto F. B., Gumel A. B., & Parham P. E.
