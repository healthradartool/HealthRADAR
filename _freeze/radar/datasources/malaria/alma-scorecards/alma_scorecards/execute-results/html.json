The filters are for *country*, *scorecard type* and *year*. To access the scorecards on *malaria*, use the filter *scorecard type* and choose any of the following depending on specific context (*Malaria*, *ALMA Scorecard for Accountability on Action*, *Commonwealth Malaria Tracker*) from the drop-down menu.\n- Under the tab country best practices, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *search*, *topic*, *types of best practices*, *country* and *year*. To access best practices for malaria, use the filter *topic*, 2 choices are available: *Malaria scorecard tools* and *End malaria councils* from the drop-down menu.\n- The video below demonstrates how to navigate the site:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Video demonstration of the ALMA Scorecard Hub\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJAk_A0bfyk >}}\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>\n\n- Some scorecards are shared as pdf files (these are downloadable)\n\n![Rwanda Malaria Scorecard](images/pdf_scorecard.png)\n\nor directly from the web platform (not downloadable, user has to scroll through the file)\n\n![Zambia Malaria Scorecard](images/web_platform%20scorecard.png)\n\n- Scorecards are color coded, the main colors of use are *green (on track)*, *yellow (in progress)*, *red (not on track)*, *grey (not applicable or no data)*, *white (no data)*.\n- Scorecards use arrows in combination with the colors, *up arrow (to show an increase)* and *down arrow (to show a decrease)*.\n- The ALMA scorecards for accountability and action gives the ALMA scorecard, the Africa Summary report and country specific reports as pdfs in any one of the following languages, *English*, *Arabic*, *Spanish*, *French*, *Swahili* and *Portuguese*.\n- Data available is for the years 2015 to 2024.\n\n<h2>Key points to consider</h2>\n\n- Downloading the [materials](https://scorecardhub.org/guides-and-toolkits/download-course-content-to-access-when-you-do-not-have-an-internet-connection/) for the online courses is highly beneficial, as they provide a comprehensive overview on how to create scorecards. This will help towards the understanding and interpretation of the scorecards.\n- The scorecards are highly country specific, indicators change according to the country's health priorities.\n\n## Visualisations\n\n<h2>How to use this data</h2>\n\n- As indicators vary across countries, it is necessary to check if the indicators of interest are within the available scorecards.\n- It is also necessary to check if the country of interest has made the country scorecard available.\n- As the scorecards are available in pdf format or as a web platform, information has to be extracted manually.\n\n<h2>How to plot this data?</h2>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the libraries\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nsource(here::here(\"radar/theme_health_radar.R\"))\n\n# Define the Rwanda provinces\nrwanda_provinces <- c(\"East\", \"South\", \"West\", \"North\", \"Kigali city\")\n\n# Load the map data for Rwanda\nrwanda_map <- ne_states(country = \"Rwanda\", returnclass = \"sf\") %>%\n  mutate(name = rwanda_provinces)\n\n# Read in data\nrwandap_data <- read_excel(\"data/rwanda_q1_provinces2022.xlsx\")\n\ncases <- rwandap_data$MalariaTotalCases \n\n# Merge the map data with your data\nrwanda_data <- rwanda_map %>%\n  left_join(rwandap_data, by = c(\"name\" = \"province\"))\n\n# Create a ggplot object with the Rwanda data\nggplot(data = rwanda_data) +\n  # Add a spatial plot with fill based on the number of cases\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = cases), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 0.3) +  \n  # Apply custom theme\n  theme_health_radar() +\n  # Apply custom fill scale for continuous data\n  scale_fill_continuous_health_radar(name = \"Total Cases\") +  \n  # Add text labels for the names, with color based on the number of cases\n  geom_sf_text(\n    aes(label = name, color = ifelse(cases > quantile(cases, 0.9), \"black\", \"white\")), size = 3) +  \n  # Use identity scale for color\n  scale_color_identity() +  \n  # Customize the theme to remove axis titles and ticks\n  theme(\n    plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  # Add caption and title to the plot\n  labs(\n    title = \"Reported malaria cases in Rwanda (2022)\",\n    caption = str_wrap(\n      \"The total number of new outpatient department (OPD) cases of malaria recorded at healthcare facilities in the five provinces of Rwanda during the first quarter of 2022.
