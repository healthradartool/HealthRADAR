The filters are for *country*, *scorecard type* and *year*. To access the scorecards on *malaria*, use the filter *scorecard type* and choose any of the following depending on specific context (*Malaria*, *ALMA Scorecard for Accountability on Action*, *Commonwealth Malaria Tracker*) from the drop-down menu.\n- Under the tab country best practices, a search can be refined through the use of available filters. The filters are for *search*, *topic*, *types of best practices*, *country* and *year*. To access best practices for malaria, use the filter *topic*, 2 choices are available: *Malaria scorecard tools* and *End malaria councils* from the drop-down menu.\n- The video below demonstrates how to navigate the site:\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## Video demonstration of the ALMA Scorecard Hub\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJAk_A0bfyk >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>\n\n- Some scorecards are shared as pdf files (these are downloadable)\n\n![Rwanda Malaria Scorecard](images/pdf_scorecard.png)\n\nor directly from the web platform (not downloadable, user has to scroll through the file)\n\n![Zambia Malaria Scorecard](images/web_platform%20scorecard.png)\n\n- Scorecards are color coded, the main colors of use are *green (on track)*, *yellow (in progress)*, *red (not on track)*, *grey (not applicable or no data)*, *white (no data)*.\n- Scorecards use arrows in combination with the colors, *up arrow (to show an increase)* and *down arrow (to show a decrease)*.\n- The ALMA scorecards for accountability and action gives the ALMA scorecard, the Africa Summary report and country specific reports as pdfs in any one of the following languages, *English*, *Arabic*, *Spanish*, *French*, *Swahili* and *Portuguese*.\n- Data available is for the years 2015 to 2024.\n\n<h2>Key points to consider</h2>\n\n- Downloading the [materials](https://scorecardhub.org/guides-and-toolkits/download-course-content-to-access-when-you-do-not-have-an-internet-connection/) for the online courses is highly beneficial, as they provide a comprehensive overview on how to create scorecards. This will help towards the understanding and interpretation of the scorecards.\n- The scorecards are highly country specific, indicators change according to the country's health priorities.\n\n## Visualisations\n\n<h2>How to use this data</h2>\n\n- As indicators vary across countries, it is necessary to check if the indicators of interest are within the available scorecards.\n- It is also necessary to check if the country of interest has made the country scorecard available.\n- As the scorecards are available in pdf format or as a web platform, information has to be extracted manually.\n\n<h2>How to plot this data?</h2>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the libraries\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(rnaturalearthdata)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nsource(here::here(\"radar/theme_health_radar.R\"))\n\n# Define the Rwanda provinces\nrwanda_provinces <- c(\"East\", \"South\", \"West\", \"North\", \"Kigali city\")\n\n# Load the map data for Rwanda\nrwanda_map <- ne_states(country = \"Rwanda\", returnclass = \"sf\") %>%\n  mutate(name = rwanda_provinces)\n\n# Read in data\nrwandap_data <- read_excel(\"rwanda_q1_provinces2022.xlsx\")\n\ncases <- rwandap_data$MalariaTotalCases \n\n# Merge the map data with your data\nrwanda_data <- rwanda_map %>%\n  left_join(rwandap_data, by = c(\"name\" = \"province\"))\n\n# Create the choropleth map\nggplot(data = rwanda_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = cases), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 0.3) +  # Use fill for the continuous 2022 data\n  theme_health_radar() +\n  scale_fill_continuous_health_radar(name = \"Total Cases\") +  # Correct fill scale for continuous data\n  labs(\n    title = \"Reported malaria cases Rwanda (by province) 1st quarter (2022)\",\n    caption = str_wrap(\"The choropleth map highlights the total number of new outpatient department (OPD) cases of malaria recorded at health facilities in the five provinces of Rwanda during the first quarter of 2022.
