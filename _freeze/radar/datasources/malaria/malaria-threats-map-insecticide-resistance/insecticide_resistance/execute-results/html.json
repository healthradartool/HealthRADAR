Following a large data consolidation exercise conducted in 2019, which included the integration of separate WHO regional databases and data from other public sources, it has become the largest database on {{< glossary \"insecticide resistance\" >}} available at present. It contains data on the status of insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles mosquitoes in more than 88 countries. The contents of the database are provided by Member States, partners (including research and academic institutes) as well as nongovernmental organizations, and are extracted from published and non-published reports on insecticide bioassays.\n\nThe database for the Malaria Threat Maps is up-loaded on an ad *hoc basis*. The database provides the most up to date and comprehensive information regarding insecticide resistance on all continents. The data can be presented in a graphical format as maps detailing individual studies and site-level data for all the threat to vector control. Dashboards depicting epidemiological profile, vectors, insecticide resistance status and spread can be developed for all countries reporting malaria. The databases are interactive and data can be added to the database as it becomes available.  Insecticide resistance maps and dashboards can be created for all countries, according to specific insecticides, resistance intensity and mechanisms of resistance. The changing insecticide resistance profile can be viewed spatially or temporally and provides a platform for countries to share insecticide resistance data as the data becomes available. Data reporting tools are also provided on the Global Malaria Programme.\n\nThese datasets provide information on decadal trends in insecticide resistance and enable comparison between countries. The data provided are on an *ad hoc* basis at a national and site-level scale. \n\n<h2>Accessing the data</h2>\n\nThe data can be accessed on the Global Malaria Programme page on the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/prevention/vector-control/global-database-on-insecticide-resistance-in-malaria-vectors). The data has a web page which includes useful contextual information as well as additional resources. The data can be viewed in the original report in excel format as it is usually preferable for modelling to have an excel spreadsheet.\n\n**Database description**\n\nThe data contained in the database can be explored and downloaded through the interactive data visualization platform [Malaria Threats Map](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/surveillance/malaria-threats-map). The platform provides thematic maps showing the status and intensity of insecticide resistance, the status of detection of various resistance mechanisms and the level of involvement of metabolic mechanisms.\n\nThe database is the source of the insecticide resistance status updates published annually in the [World malaria report](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports) and of the [Global report on insecticide resistance in malaria vectors: 2010-2016](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241514057). It has also been used for the [annual bulletin](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-UCN-GMP-MME-2022.01) of the WHO Mekong Malaria Elimination programme, the [ALMA score cards](https://scorecardhub.org/) and [APLMA leaders dashboard](https://dashboard.aplma.org/) and in worldwide research exercises aiming to improve understanding the spread and evolution of insecticide resistance.\n\n**Data inclusion criteria**\n\nThe database includes results from bioassays conducted following the standard WHO and CDC procedures for insecticide resistance monitoring in malaria vector mosquitoes with validated, or tentatively validated, discriminating concentrations, as well as results from biochemical and molecular assays. Results of bioassays conducted with non-standard discriminating concentrations are excluded.\n\n**Data sources**\n\nThe data are provided by WHO Member States, as well as partner institutions (including research institutes and nongovernmental organizations), some of which run partner platforms such as Vector Base or IR Mapper and are regularly extracted from publications in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.\n\n**Data quality control**\n\nData reported by WHO Member States are checked for validity and consistency at WHO country, regional and headquarters levels before being included in the database. Data from partner institutions are checked at WHO headquarters level.\n\n<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>\n\nThe data is in excel spreadsheets used to generate maps of insecticide distribution as well as dashboard summaries of the country situation.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe database contains resutls from:\n\n  - Insecticide susceptibility bioassays (i.e. WHO tube test, WHO bottle bioassay and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] bottle assays)\n\n  - Intensity bioassays\n\n  - Synergist-insecticide bioassays\n\n  - Biochemical and molecular assays to detect the presence of various resistance mechanisms (i.e. mono-oxygenases, esterases, GSTs, kdr L1014S, kdr L1014F, Ace1R).\n\nThe information included typically looks like this. Data are available for each country and annually. Some datasheets contain a few years of data, while others report data for the most recent year. To make a longer time series of data, you can access older databases such as the African Network for Vector Resistance (ANVR) from the WHO. Be careful to ensure that the definitions indicate whether the normal concentrations were tested and whether intensity assays were conducted as well as information on methodology to be sure that data sets can be compared.\n\n<h2>Key points to consider</h2>\n\n  - The data include assays conducted with fewer than the minimum recommended number of mosquitoes (i.e. 100 female anopheline mosquitoes tested in {{< glossary \"WHO susceptibility tests\" >}}) as in the absence of other data these results are informative despite the small sample size.\n  \n  - Data from WHO susceptibility tests and CDC bottle bioassays are included. However, these measure different outcomes and results are therefore not directly comparable to those from WHO tests.\n  \n  - Mosquito collection durations may span two calendar years; hence, the year indicated for a test result in the database is the year when collection of mosquitoes began for that test.\n  \n  - Insecticide resistance status varies spatially and temporally. Annual national data, provided for summary purposes, are not necessarily reflective of local situations. For decision-making purposes, the most recent data and those at the lowest possible geographical level should be used. \n  \n  - Data quality is dependent on the correct implementation of the standard insecticide resistance test procedures. Ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity, as well as the procedures followed to rear and handle the mosquitoes during the test, may cause significant variations in test results that hamper the comparability of results in time and space. Countries and institutions are encouraged to strictly follow the WHO standard operation procedures for resistance monitoring.\n\n<h2>Examples of data use in literature</h2>\n\n1.\tWHO: Global vector control response 2017-2030.

Sometimes the data needs to be prepared before it can be plotted. \n\n![Table 1. The pyrethroid resistance intensity data for KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa (2016)](images/table_1_pyrethroid_resistance.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nData has been extracted for KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa looking at pyrethroid resistance in *Anopheles arabiensis*, the local vector mosquito. Insecticide intensity studies looking at deltamethrin and permethrin showed that there was no significant resistance to Deltamethrin at 5X the discrimination dose and for Permethrin at 10X the discriminating dose. At normal concentration, there is some resistance as indicated by the low levels of mortality. Intensity assays show that this has not translated to operational resistance.\n\n<h2>How to plot this data</h2>\n\n![Figure 1. The distribution of pyrethroid resistance in South Africa.](images/distribution_of_pyrethroid_resistance_in_south_africa.jpg){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nThis is a graphical representation of Table 1.  This shows the distribution of pyrethroid resistance in KwaZulu-Natal for 2010-2024. The resistance is to a specific type of pyrethroid, namely, deltamethrin and the vector that was tested was *Anopheles arabiensis*.\n\n![Figure 2. The distribution of pyrethroid resistance on the African continent.](images/distribution_of_pyrethroid_resistance_on_the_african_contitnent.png{fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nResistance to {{< glossary Pyrethroids >}} has been identified from most countries in Africa but there is a scarcity of data on insecticide resistance intensity. The above figure shows the distribution of the intensity of pyrethroid resistance on the African continent which ranges from low to moderate in the east and south to moderate to high in the west. This map is made up of 1445 bioassays with the majority being in north-western Africa.\n\n\n## Modelling Example\n\n<h2>How can this data be used in disease modelling?</h2>\n\nWe use the results of discriminating concentration bioassays in Mozambique to inform the levels of insecticide resistance. These bioassays measure the concentration of insecticide required to differentiate between susceptible and resistant vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the data from Mozambique\ninsecticide_data <- read_excel(\"MTM_DISCRIMINATING_CONCENTRATION_BIOASSAY_20250330.xlsx\", sheet = 2)\n\n# Proportion of instances of confirmed resistance \nres = sum(insecticide_data$RESISTANCE_STATUS == \"Confirmed resistance\")/nrow(insecticide_data)\n\n# Summarise insecticide resistance data \ninsecticide_data_summ <- insecticide_data |> \n  mutate(MORTALITY_ADJUSTED = as.numeric(insecticide_data$MORTALITY_ADJUSTED)) |> \n  group_by(YEAR_START, RESISTANCE_STATUS) |> \n  summarise(mean_mortality = mean(MORTALITY_ADJUSTED), .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  complete(YEAR_START = full_seq(YEAR_START, 1), RESISTANCE_STATUS) |>\n  mutate(time = (YEAR_START - min(YEAR_START)) * 365)\n\ninsecticide_data_summ |> \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(x = YEAR_START, y = mean_mortality, colour = as_factor(\t\nRESISTANCE_STATUS))) +\n  theme_health_radar() +\n  scale_colour_manual_health_radar() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +\n  labs(title = \"Summary of mosquito mortality\",\n       subtitle = \"Results from MTM discriminating concentration bioassay\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Adjusted mosquito mortality (%)\",\n       colour = \"Resistance status\",\n       caption = \"Source: Malaria Threats Map\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](insecticide_resistance_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){fig-pos='H' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe incorporate this data into the model in two ways:\n\n-   Selection Pressure, as the proportion of vectors that start as resistant due to prior selection by insecticide use. From the data we find that in 115 of the 529 bioassays conducted resistance was confirmed, and set the selection pressure $res$ at 21%.\n\n-   Adjusting the effectiveness of interventions, $effr_{level}$ to represent the reduced effectiveness of an intervention such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) against resistant mosquitoes.\n\nIn a more complex model you may also have different rates of mosquito mortality $\\mu_m$, susceptibility to infection $b$, or biting rates $a$ (due to fitness costs) for insecticide-sensitive and resistant vectors.\n\nIn this simple model example, we assume the coverage of LLINs to be constant at 60%, further reduced by the usage rate. A more detailed example of the implementation of LLINs (including effectiveness, attrition and insecticidal decay) into a transmission model can be found [here](https://uct-masha.quarto.pub/healthradar/radar/datasources/malaria/dhs-program/dhs.html). We demonstrate the impact of vector insecticide resistance on the effective coverage of LLINs.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Time points for the simulation\nY = 14 # Years of simulation\ntimes <- seq(0, 365*Y, by = 1)\n\n# Estimates of resistance levels over time\nresdata <- insecticide_data_summ |> \n  filter(RESISTANCE_STATUS == \"Confirmed resistance\") |> \n  mutate(mean_mortality = mean_mortality/100) # convert into decimal\n\n# Make a time dependent variable of resistance levels\neffr_level <- approxfun(resdata$time, resdata$mean_mortality, n = 365*Y, ties = \"ordered\", method = \"constant\", rule = 2)\n\n# SEACR-SEI model\nseacr <- function(times, start, parameters, effr_level) { \n  with(as.list(c(start, parameters)), {\n    P = S + E + A + C + R + G \n    M_s = Sm_s + Em_s + Im_s\n    M_r = Sm_r + Em_r + Im_r\n    M = M_s + M_r\n    m = M / P\n    \n    # Seasonality\n    seas.t <- amp*(1+cos(2*pi*(times/365-phi)))\n   \n    # Nets\n    itn <- itn_cov*itn_use\n    itn_r <- itn*(1 -
