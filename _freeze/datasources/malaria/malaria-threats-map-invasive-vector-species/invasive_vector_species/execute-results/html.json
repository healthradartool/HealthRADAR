At present, the database contains data on detection of *Anopheles stephensi* outside of its native ecosystems.\"\ndate: 10/23/2024 # mm-dd-yyyy\nimage: \"images/invasive_vector_species.png\"\n\ncategories:\n  - entomology\n  - malaria vectors\n  - new vectors of malaria\n  - emerging vectors of malaria\n  - vector species\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.page-tabs .panel-tabset}\n## Overview\n\n<h2>About the data</h2>\n\nThe global database on invasive mosquito vector species was established in 2019 following the recommendations of the WHO's first Technical Consultation on the spread of *Anopheles stephensi*. The database is designed to allow tracking of the geographical spread of malaria vector species that pose a threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. The database aims to support the evaluation of risks posed by invasive vector species and to promote and inform prompt action to mitigate this risk.\n\nThese datasets provide information on long term trends in distribution and spread of new or emerging mosquito vectors of malaria and enable tracking the spread of invasive vector species such as *Anopheles stephensi* comparison between countries. The data provided are on an annual time scale at the national level and would not be suitable for subnational analysis or to explore seasonal trends in malaria.\n\nTracking surveillance activities helps to understand current research gaps. Knowledge of where studies are either being planned, currently underway, or recently completed, helps to inform where to direct resources for future studies.\n\n<h2>\n\nAccessing the data\n\n</H2>\n\nThe data can be accessed via the WHO website through its Global Malaria Programme page on the [Malaria Threats Map](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/stories?theme=prevention). The data has a web page which includes useful contextual information as well as additional resources. The data can be viewed in the original report in excel format as it is usually preferable for modelling to have an excel spreadsheet.\n\n-   To access the data, click on the [link](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats) to access the [Malaria Threats Map](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/) page.\n-   Click on the data download tile.\n-   Select the theme `Invasive Vector Species` to access the `Invasive Vector Species` detections.\n-   Data can be filtered according to `species` and `year` (1984-2024) in which collected.\n-   Filter can be applied according to location.\n-   Follow the prompts to select and download data.\n-   The data is downloaded as an Excel file.\n\nThe downloaded data can be plotted according to the geography for which the filters were selected (species, year collected and location). At this stage, dashboard summaries are not available for this thematic area.\n\n<h2>What does the data look like?</h2>\n\nSometimes the data needs to be prepared before it is able to be plotted.\n\n![Figure 1: Distribution of *Anopheles stephensi* in Kenya for 2022-2024.](images/distributionn_of_anopheles_stephensi_kenya.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nThe distribution of *An. stephensi* was plotted for all districts in Kenya between 2022-2024. The method employed for collecting the specimens were recorded and the main methods of collection were the dipping method for mosquito larvae and the use of the light trap for collection of adult mosquitoes. The species identification was confirmed using molecular techniques.\n\n**Description**\n\nThe data can be viewed as a spreadsheet, plotted on a map to show distribution or as a dashboard giving a summary of epidemiological and entomological data. The data can also be downloaded as Excel documents from the \"Download Data\" page.\n\n![Figure 2: The occurrence of all invasive species from 2010 â€“ 2024.](images/occurance_of_invasive_species.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of all invasive mosquito species in Africa and south-east Asia for the past 14 years. It is apparent that *An. stephensi* is native to south-east Asia but it is an invasive species in north Africa. A number of sites were negative for *An. stephensi*. This information can be used for revising malaria control protocols.\n\n![Figure 3: Sample of the summary dashboard that can be created using the distribution data.](images/summary_dashboard.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nFigure 3 shows a snap-shot of the summary data that can be generated from the selected dataset with the use of the appropriate filters. In this example, the vectors of Angola are listed and it is evident that *An. stephensi* has not yet moved down along the west coast of Africa. The insecticide resistance status of the vector mosquitoes is also given. The [complete dashboard](https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/dashboards?country=AO&theme=prevention) provides more information.\n\n<h2>Citing the data</h2>\n\nPlease acknowledge the use of these datasets by including the following reference in your publications: https://apps.who.int/malaria/maps/threats/#/download.

(2022](https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-022-05414-4)) in their exploration of invasive *Aedes* species.\n\nThis can further inform spatial risk mapping and/or be used to forecast further invasions of the species.\n\nThese findings can also be used as inputs for models that evaluate intervention impact, as far as targeted vector control and changes in their effectiveness due to the presence of invasive species.\n:::\n",
